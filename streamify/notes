1. stopped at 4. core.module.ts
2. why graphql.config.ts is showing error? 
wrong path with @/src because no src under @? src is under server? 
should we change tsconfig.json but then we change everywhere? 


week 3: 
2. wire up accountmodule
do we create a new core.module.ts under src/core ? 
or what we have core.module.ts under core/config? 


done
